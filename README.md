Rock Band drums environment for Etterna. So far only pump it up mode is supported fully (4 heads and kick)

The plan is to support regular Rock Band, Rock Band Pro, and Guitar Hero modes by utilising pump, doubles, and solo stepmania files. Of course the three modes will have noteskin variances tailored to each one. Pro mode will include hats, GH will look like GH. You get the point.

Preferably the scoring systems from either of the two games would be supported but I'm not sure if that is even possible.

Since >4k modes don't have a working calc, a very simple chart rating system will be put in place. I'm unsure how well that'll go if I get something thrown together at all, however.
