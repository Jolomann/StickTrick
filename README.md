Let me first clarify that this is in absolutely no way close to complete. That said, it is kind of playable once you're past the initial setup

Rock Band drums environment for Etterna. **So far only pump it up mode is supported fully (4 heads and kick)**

The plan is to support regular Rock Band, Rock Band Pro, and Guitar Hero modes by utilising pump, doubles, and solo Stepmania files. Of course the three modes will have noteskin variances tailored to each one. Pro mode will include hats, GH will look like GH. You get the point.

Preferably the scoring systems from either of the two games would be supported but I'm not sure if that is even possible through theme changes alone.


# HOW TO PLAY

**MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING ETTERNA VERSION .66.1** BECAUSE THERE IS NO GUARANTEE IT WILL WORK ON ANY OTHER VERSIONS. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD VERSION .66.1 HERE IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT<br/>
64-bit: https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/releases/download/v0.66.1/Etterna-0.66.1-x64.exe<br/>
32-bit: https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/releases/download/v0.66.1/Etterna-0.66.1-i386.exe<br/>

Make sure to **select PUMP gamemode** (Main menu -> options -> select game -> pump)

Make sure to **use the provided theme**. It looks very much like the Etterna default theme on the surface, but there are internal changes which tunes the theme specifically for playing drums instead of keyboard

The provided noteskin(s) force an aggressive hallway perspective, meaning that scroll speed will feel vastly slower than normal. You can approximately **use 2.5x your normal cmod** to achieve the same perceived speed (e.g. c800 -> c2000). This has not been double checked with math or anything, it's simply a rough approximation
